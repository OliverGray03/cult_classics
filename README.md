# Design
## Typography
- The typography used throughout the site was called Lato taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Colour Scheme 
 - I took inspiration for my colour scheme from big sporting brand websites like Nike and Addidas. Both these use start contrast of white and black with accent colours throughout. With Cult Classics being a sports related website i wanted to replicate the feel of these brands. 

 - The below was my full colour scheme created using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)

![colour scheme](media/readme/colourscheme.png)

    - #FFF Was primarily used for the background and some contrasting buttons
    - #000 Was primarily used as contrasting features, for example the nav bar and footer
    - #DEE0C8 was used throughout the site for detailing, including line breaks and the delivery banner
    - #7E7E7E Was used for text throughout the site

## Icons
- Icons were chosen and used throughout the site using Fontawesome, i have used icons that are recognisable to everyone from using day to day apps and websites

# Testing

Testing for the site can all be found on the below link; 

## [TESTING.MD](TESTING.MD)


# Deployment
## Local Deployment
Before deploying the project there are some requirements to be set up first.

First ensure the following are set up on your chosen IDE:
- [PIP3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) Python package installer. 
- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) or higher.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control.

Secondly you will need an account with Stripe in order to allow for online purchasing.

To set the project up locally you can follow the following steps: 

1. Navigate to the repository - [cult_classics](https://github.com/OliverGray03/cult_classics)

2. Click the code dropdown button, ensure the HTTPS tab is selected in the dropdown and copy the url. 

3. In your IDE navigate to the desired directory. 

4. Open the terminal and enter the following code: 
    - ```
        git clone https://github.com/OliverGray03/cult_classics.git
        ```

Note: Alternatively you can select the "Download Zip" option from the dropdown menu, and extract the zip file to your chosen directory within your IDE. 

5. To install the required dependencies needed to run the application type the following into the terminal: 
    - ```
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```

6. Environment variables will then need to be set up. This can be done in a couple of ways: 
    1. Create an env.py file in the root directory, and ensure that it is added to the .gitignore file so that secret keys aren't published to github. Add to the following code to the the env.py file:
        - ```
            import os
            os.enviorn["DEVELOPMENT"] = True
            os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Your Secret Key"
            os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "Your Stripe Public Key"
            os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "Your Stripe Secret Key"
            os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "Your Stripe WH Secret Key"
            ```
    
    2. Set the environment variables with your IDE settings (if available):
        - |  Key  |  Value  |
          |-----| ----- |
          | DEVELOPMENT | True |
          | SECRET_KEY | Your Secret Key |
          | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | Your Stripe Public Key |
          | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | Your Stripe Secret Key |
          | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | Your Stripe WH Secret Key |

    - Your stripe variables can be located on your stripe dashboard. 
    - You can generate a secret key at [Django Secret Key Generator](https://djecrety.ir/)

7. To set up the database you will need to migrate the database models. To do so type the following into the terminal: 
    - ```
        python3 manage.py makemigrations
        python3 manage.py migrate
        ```

8. To load the product fixtures into the database type the following into the terminal:
    - ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata master_category
        python3 manage.py loaddata product_category
        python3 manage.py loaddata products
        ```

9. Create a superuser to have access to the django admin section by typing the following: 
    - ```
        python3 manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
    - Follow the commands in the terminal for the superuser details. 

10. You will then be able to run the app locally using the following command: 
    - ```
        python3 manage.py runserver
        ```


## Deployment to Heroku

1. Create a Heroku app: 
    - Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and log in or sign up. 
    - From the dashboard click on new app and give the app a name and choose the region closest to you. 
    - On the resources tab provision a new postgres database by typing in heroku postgres.
2. To use Postgres dj_database_url & psycopg2 need to be installed. 
    - In the terminal type the following commands:
        - ```
            pip3 install dj_database_url
            ```
        - ```
            pip3 install psycopg2-binary
            ```
3. Make sure Heroku installs all our apps requirements when we deploy it using the following command in the terminal:
    - ```
        pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
4. To setup the websites new database navigate to settings.py import dj_database_url & comment out the default database configuration and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse. 
    - ```
        import dj_database_url
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse("your Postgres database URL in heroku")
        }
        ```
5. We need to run all migrations to the new Postgres database by entering the following in the terminal:
    - ```
        python3 manage.py migrate
        ```
6. We need to load the product data from the fixtures file into the new database: 
    - ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata master_categories
        python3 manage.py loaddata product_categories
        python3 manage.py loaddata products
        ```
7. A superuser was created with admin rights by typing the following into the terminal:
    - ```
        python3 manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
    - Follow the commands in the terminal for Username, email address and password
8. Add an if statement in settings.py for the default database, so that if the app is running on Heroku it connects to the Postgres database, otherwise the app connects to the SQLite3 database: 
    - ```
        if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
            DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }
        else:
            DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                    'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                }
            }
        ```
9. Gunicorn (Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX) will act as our webserver. To install it type the following into the terminal:
    - ```
        pip3 install gunicorn
        ```
    - Freeze that into the requirments file using: 
        - ```
            pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
            ```
10. Create a procfile in the root directory, to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run gunicorn and serve the Django app. Type the following into the procfile: 
    - ```
        web: gunicorn cult_classics.wsgi:application
        ```
11. After logging in to Heroku at the command line we need to temporarily disable collectstatic so Heroku won't try to collect static files when deployed: 
    - ```
        heroku login -i
        heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app "app name goes here"
        ```
12. In settings.py we need to add the hostname of our Heroku app, and allow localhost so gitpod will still work too: 
    - ```
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['"app name goes here".herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
        ```
13. To deploy to Heroku type the following into the command line: 
    - ```
        heroku git:remote -a "app name goes here"
        git push heroku master
        ```
14. To set up automatic deployments when we push the code to github, in Heroku:
    - On the deploy tab set the app to connect to github by searching for the repository and clicking connect.
    - Click 'Enable Automatic Deploys" 
15. Using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://djecrety.ir/) add the secret key to the config variables under the settings tab, which will act as the key for the Heroku app. 
    - We need to update the settings.py file so that the secret key is collected from the environment, and use an empty string as default: 
        - ```
            SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
            ```
    - Additionally set the debug to be true only if there's a variable called "DEVELOPMENT" in the environment. 
        - ```
            DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
            ```

## static files and AWS
### Creating a New Bucket

1. Navigate to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in or sign up. 
2. From the AWS Management Console search for S3 in the services menu. 
3. Click the "create bucket" button and enter the following information:
    - Bucket Name: recommended to be the same name as the Heroku App. 
    - Region: enter the region that is closest to you.
    - Uncheck the "Block all public access" checkbox and acknowledge that the Bucket will be public.
    - Click the "Create bucket" button to create the bucket. 
4. Set some settings by clicking on the bucket that appears: 
    - Click the properties tab and turn on static website hosting, which gives a new endpoint to access the bucket from the internet. 
    - Click the properties tab to make 3 changes:
        1. Set the CORS configuration to: 
            - ```
                [
                    {
                        "AllowedHeaders": [
                            "Authorization"
                        ],
                        "AllowedMethods": [
                            "GET"
                        ],
                        "AllowedOrigins": [
                            "*"
                        ],
                        "ExposeHeaders": []
                    }
                ]
                ```
        2. Create a Security Policy for this Bucket using AWS S3 Bucket Policy generator located in the Bucket Policy tab:
            - Select the following options:
                - Policy Type: "S3 Bucket Policy"
                - Principal: Allow all principals using "*"
                - Actions: select "GetObject"
                - ARN: Copy the ARN from the permissions tab
            - Once the policy is generated copy the JSON document into the Bucket Policy editor. 
            - Before saving add a "/*" to the end of the resource key to allow access to all resources in this bucket.
            - Click the "Save" button. 
        3. Access the "Access Control List" tab, in the "Permissions" tab, and set the list objects permission for everyone under the "Public Access" section.

### Creating AWS Groups, Policies and Users

1. From the services menu search for IAM.
2. From the Access Management dropdown select 'User Groups'.

        - Click the "Review Policy" button and give the policy a name and description and click the "create policy" button.
4. To attach the policy to the relevant group go back to the "User Groups" page:
    - Click the group you want to attach the policy to. 
    - Click "Attach Policy" 
    - Search for the policy that has been created and click the "Attach Policy" button.
5. From the Access Management dropdown click Users: 
    - Click the "Add User" button: 
        - Enter a user name and select the "Programmatic access' checkbox and select next: 
            - On the next page add the user to the group that was created and click through to create the user. 
        - Once the user is added download the CSV file which will contain the user's access key and secret access key, which will be used to authenticate the user from the Django App. 

### Connecting Django to S3

1. In order to connect the S3 bucket to django two new packages are required: 
    - ```
        pip3 install boto3
        ```
    - ```
        pip3 install django_storages
        ```
    - Add the new dependencies to the requirements with the following: 
        - ```
            pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
            ```
    - Add Django-storages to the list of INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py file: 
        - ```
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                'django.contrib.admin',
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                'django.contrib.sessions',
                'django.contrib.messages',
                'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                'django.contrib.sites',
                'allauth',
                'allauth.account',
                'allauth.socialaccount',
                'home',
                'products',
                'bag',
                'checkout',
                'profiles',
                'contact',
                'favorites',

                # Other
                'crispy_forms',
                'storages',
            ]
            ```
2. To connect Django to S3 we need to update the settings.py file to tell Django which bucket it should be communicating with. We only want to this in the Heroku, so we can add an if statement to check if theres an environment variable called USE_AWS in the environment. 
    - ```
        if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
            AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'ogray-cultclassics'
            AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
            AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
        ```
    - In Heroku we need to update the config variables: 
        - |  Key  |  Value  |
          |-----| ----- |
          | USE_AWS | True |
          | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Found in the CSV file when creating a user in IAM |
          | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Found in the CSV file when creating a user in IAM |
        - We need to remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable as django will now collect static files and upload them to S3. 
3. COLLECTSTATIC was renabled so that in production Django uses S3 to store static files and uploads new product and blog images to the bucket:
    - To do so create a new file in the root directory called 'custom_storages.py':
        - ```
            from django.conf import settings
            from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


            class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
                location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


            class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
                location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
            ```
    - In settings.py these new storage classes were attached to new variables within the 'USE_AWS' block, so that in production static files are saved in a folder called 'static' and media files are saved in the folder called 'media'. URL's for media and static files have been overwritten using the custom domain and new locations:
        - ```
            if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
                # Bucket Config
                AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'ogray-cultclassics'
                AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
                AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
                AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
                AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

                # Static and media files
                STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
                STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
                DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
                MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

                # Override static and media URL's in production
                STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
                MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
            ```
    - To improve performance for our end users we can tell the browser that it's okay to cache static files for a long time since they don't change very often: 
        - Inside the 'USE_AWS' code block: 
            - ```
                # Cache Control
                AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
                    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
                    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
                }
                ```
4. In the S3 bucket create a new folder called 'media'. 
    - Inside the media folder click upload -> add files and select all the product, blog and site images:
        - Select 'Grant public read access to these objects' before clicking through to 'upload'. 

## Stripe and Heroku

1. Log in to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) 
2. From the dashboard go to "developer" and select API Keys. Copy the publishable and secret keys and add them as config variables in Heroku:
    - |  Key  |  Value  |
      |-----| ----- |
      | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | From Stripe |
      | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | From Stripe |
3. Add a new webhook endpoint by clicking webhooks in the developers menu on stripe and clicking the "add endpoint" button: 
    - Add the endpoint as the URL for the heroku app followed by "checkout/wh/", and set up to receive all events: 
        - ```
            https://ogray-cultclassics.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/

            ```
4. Copy the signing secret for the new webhook and add it to the heroku config variables: 
    - |  Key  |  Value  |
      |-----| ----- |
      | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | From Stripe |

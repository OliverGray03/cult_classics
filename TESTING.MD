    2. As a first time user i would like to see easy to understand and use navigation to move around the site
        - The navigation bar is split into two sections, the top nav contains the business brand name which is clickable link returning to the home screen from whichever page the user is on, secondly there is a large search bar for use when a user has a specific product in mind which they would like to search for and lastly there are two links, one which opens up a page menu and the second which opens up the users shopping bag. 
        - The second second of the nav bar contains four product categories for the user to use as search filters. 
        - All links in the nav bar and the footer are universally recogniseable making navigation around these links intuitive for the user. For example, the search bar collapses to a magnifying glass icon and the shopping bag icon is a bag. 
        - The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen so it is consistant with other websites and always accesable for users.

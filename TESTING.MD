    2. As a first time user i would like to see easy to understand and use navigation to move around the site
        - The navigation bar is split into two sections, the top nav contains the business brand name which is clickable link returning to the home screen from whichever page the user is on, secondly there is a large search bar for use when a user has a specific product in mind which they would like to search for and lastly there are two links, one which opens up a page menu and the second which opens up the users shopping bag. 
        - The second second of the nav bar contains four product categories for the user to use as search filters. 
        - All links in the nav bar and the footer are universally recogniseable making navigation around these links intuitive for the user. For example, the search bar collapses to a magnifying glass icon and the shopping bag icon is a bag. 
        - The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen so it is consistant with other websites and always accesable for users.

# Browser Compatibility & Functionality Testing

- Browser compatibility
    - The site was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers
    - The site was veiwed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, laptop, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone X and iPad mini 4
    - The above testing showed no errors and the website is cross-browser and cross-device compatible

- Functionality Testing


## Known Bugs & Fixes
- Whilst creating the favorites function i noticed the product was saving to the users favorites and displayed the "remove from favorites" rather than "add to favorites", however on going to the users favorites back then back to all products the page refreshed all products to say "Add to favorites" even though the product was still in the users favorites list. To overcome this i moved the favorites code in the "all_products" view from the top of the function to the bottom as the page was refreshing and resetting all the products after the favorites in the code. 

- Whilst finalising the favourites functionality i realsied i was using the same looped code for the all products, favourites list in product detail and the favourites list. To comply with DRY i refactored the code to use an include function with a singular HTML file for the product loop. 

## Future improvements
- A useful feature to add would be a newsletter users could sign up to, encouraging more site visitors to create an account whilst also being able to offer discounts and detail on new products to the user. 
- Another useful feature to add for the future would be a welcome discount for all newly registered users, enticing the user to spend on the site and encouraging more users to register to the site.
